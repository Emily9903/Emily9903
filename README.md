Hi, I'm Emily.

I am an aspiring software developer and have recently completed a 16 week coding bootcamp with School of Code. :smile:
After spending 5 Â½ years doing admin work for the NHS, I was introduced to the world of coding through a friend last 
year and I knew I wanted to jump in with both feet and work in tech!
